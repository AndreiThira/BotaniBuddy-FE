# BotaniBuddy-FE

This is a group project created by students at Northcoders. The project idea and tech stack was decided by the group and had to include two new technologies (in our case MongoDB and ReactNative). BotaniBuddy is a collaborative project created by a group of students from Northcoders. This phone application empowers users to effortlessly identify plants by simply taking a picture and receive an accurate identification in return. In addition to plant identification, the application allows users to create a digital garden, where they can keep track of the plants they've identified and receive personalized daily tasks.

The BackEnd can be found [here](https://github.com/AndreiThira/BotaniBuddy-BE-fork).

### Usage Guide <a name="Installation"></a>

The app is optimized for iOS, but some considerations have been made for Android by including a ratio function for the camera. While the application is not yet hosted, you can access it locally by following these steps:

1. **Fork and Clone Repository**:
   - Start by forking the repository on GitHub.
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.

2. **Open in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:
   - Open your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code).
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open the terminal within VS Code.
   - Type the following command to install project dependencies:
